   The "Scents Symphony" project represents a fascinating virtual destination for perfume enthusiasts, offering them the opportunity to explore and purchase a variety of exceptional scents. Developed using ASP.NET Core MVC technology and the C# programming language, "Scents Symphony" combines elegance and efficiency to provide a colorful and refined online shopping experience. With an intuitive interface and advanced functionalities, this website aims to offer customers a pleasant and personalized experience in exploring and purchasing their favorite perfumes. ASP.NET Core MVC is a powerful framework for building web applications and APIs, based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model. It is developed by Microsoft as a more modern, modular, and efficient version of ASP.NET. In the MVC structure, the model defines the business rules and data structure of the application, the view is responsible for displaying the user interface and presenting user data, while the controller manages user interaction, working with the model to retrieve data and select the appropriate view for response.
